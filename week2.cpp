////in a C++ constructor, you should initialize your simple data types (int, double, bool, float) however, your objects

//    private:

//
//if you don't initialize your variables before the constructor body {} then the objects are initialized first
//with the empty constructor, this causes problems.. Why?

//When the compiler allocates memory for A, it needs to know how much memory to reserve. That must be done before the body {}
    //Ex: if we create a class A and use its default constructor...
    // when we initialize in the method body, it deletes any memory allocated in the first allocation, then allocates
    // new memory.
